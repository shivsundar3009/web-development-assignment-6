OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects and data rather than just functions and logic. It provides a way to structure and design programs by representing real-world entities as objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

The key principles of OOPS include:

01. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. It allows for the hiding of internal implementation details and exposes only the necessary information and behavior through methods. Encapsulation helps achieve data abstraction, security, and code modularity.

02. Inheritance: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, creating a hierarchy of classes. It enables code reuse and the creation of specialized objects based on existing ones. Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes, where a subclass inherits characteristics from its superclass.

03. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. It allows objects to be treated as instances of their own class or any of their parent classes. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility and extensibility.

04. Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and understandable components. It allows you to focus on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. In OOPS, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, providing a blueprint for subclasses to implement.

05. Association: Association represents relationships between objects, where one object is connected to another object. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship. Associations are formed through instance variables that hold references to other objects. Associations are essential for building complex systems by connecting objects together.

06. Composition: Composition is a form of association where one object contains other objects as part of its state. It implies a strong relationship where the lifetime of the contained objects is dependent on the lifetime of the container object. Composition allows for the creation of complex objects by combining simpler objects.

OOPS promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability by providing a structured approach to programming. It allows for the creation of objects with well-defined interfaces, encapsulating data and behavior. This paradigm helps manage complexity, improve code organization, and facilitate collaboration in large-scale software development. Many programming languages, including JavaScript, Java, C++, and Python, support OOPS concepts and provide features to implement them effectively.
