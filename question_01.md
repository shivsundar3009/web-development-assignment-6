In JavaScript, a constructor is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize objects. It is typically defined as a member method within a class or a constructor function, and it is invoked with the `new` keyword.

The purpose of a constructor is to set up the initial state and behavior of an object. When a new object is created using the constructor, it is allocated memory and its properties are initialized based on the values passed as arguments to the constructor. The constructor can also define methods and other members that will be available to instances of the object.

Here's an example of a constructor function in JavaScript:

```
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;

  this.sayHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  };
}

var john = new Person("John", 25);
john.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John"
```

In the above example, `Person` is a constructor function that takes `name` and `age` as arguments. When a new `Person` object is created using the `new` keyword, the `name` and `age` properties are assigned based on the provided arguments. The `sayHello` method is also defined within the constructor, which can be invoked on instances of the `Person` object.

Constructors provide a way to create multiple objects of the same type with similar behavior and properties. They are essential in object-oriented programming and allow for the creation of instances that encapsulate data and functionality specific to that type of object.
